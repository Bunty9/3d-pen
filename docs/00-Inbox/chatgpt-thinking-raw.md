computer. We made the device using an ESP32, gyroscope, and a battery pack. We wrote a BLE client that runs on our computer using a Python called Bleak. The python program receives gyroscope data from the ESP32 over BLE and draws on a canvas accordingly. With our device, we are able to draw shapes and even write words that are legible as long as they are big enough. While it is not able to transcribe fine movements like we hoped, it is still satisfying to see that we can write using our device.

would still continue to drift. The second issue that caused accuracy issues was the rate we were sending and receiving data over bluetooth. We decided to send a packet just one position of information over bluetooth every 100 milliseconds which restricted the drawing to work at 10 frames per second. This made the drawing much less accurate and stuttered. We wanted to implement a better method to send multiple position vectors in the packets and so the drawings would be smoother. This would create a delay of 100 milliseconds but we thought it would be worth the sacrifice. Sadly we did not have the time to implement such a method. Other additions to this project would include adding the ability to save

Enhancing IMU-Based Online Handwriting Recognition via Contrastive Learning with Zero Inference Overhead
Early IMU -based handwriting recognition relied heavily on manual feature engineering and statistical modeling. Researchers typically employed sensor fusion techniques, such as quaternion-based complementary filters, to reconstruct motion trajectories from raw accelerometer and gyroscope signals [ 35]. Dynamic time warping served as the standard approach for handling temporal variations in isolated characters [8 , 36]. For more complex sequences, probabilistic models like hidden Markov models were used for both character classification [3] and continuous text spotting in 3D space

Enhancing IMU-Based Online Handwriting Recognition via Contrastive Learning with Zero Inference Overhead
The advent of deep learning shifted the focus toward end-to-end neural networks that extract features directly from raw data. Architectures combining convolutional neural networks and 40 (LSTM ) networks became the standard for capturing spatial and temporal dependencies. By using 34 loss, these models align unsegmented sensor streams to text, which enables robust word and sentence recognition [24 , 42]. More

(PDF) Ohmic-Sticker: Force-to-Motion Type Input Device that Extends Capacitive Touch Surface
We propose "Ohmic-Sticker'', a novel force-to-motion type input device to extend capacitive touch surfaces. It realizes various types of force-sensitive inputs by simply attaching on to commercial touchpads or touchscreens. A simple force- sensitive-resistor (FSR)-based structure enables thin (less than 2 mm) form factors and battery-less operation. The applied force vector is detected as the leakage current from the corresponding touch surface electrodes by using Ohmic- Touch technology. Ohmic-Sticker can be used for adding force-sensitive interactions to touch surfaces, such as analog push buttons, TrackPoint-like devices, and full 6 DoF controllers for navigating virtual spaces.
